- [ ] Assign development team members to landing page system
- [ ] Begin Week 1: Core infrastructure development

## Session Context
**Previous Session**: Comprehensive project audit and agent-system fixes completed
**Current Status**: Project health score 65/100, critical blocker: waiting list implementation pending
**Known Issues**: No assigned owners for waiting list development, auth flows need restoration

## Implementation Plan

2. Set up development timeline (5-week implementation plan)
3. Begin database schema for waiting list
4. Fix Auth() login functionality
